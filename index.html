            <h2>Olympic Park</h2>
        <p>The Olympic Park in Munich was used in 1972 and is now a tourist attraction; these Olympic games were also the site of a massacre when a military group kidnapped and executed Israeli athletes. The stadium and surrounding area are still used for many events, including farmers markets and concerts. The park is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Across from the Olympic Park is the BMW museum.

            <h2>English Garden</h2>
        <p>The English Garden is located a short distance from Munich University. It was created in 1789 and is 3.75km squared, making it one of the largest city parks in the world. The name comes from the fact that the park is not laid out like the French Baroque parks that were common at the time but is an English landscape park. A Rome-styled gazebo, beer garden, theatre, restaurants, and many other things are within the park.</p> </section>

            <h2>Odeonsplatz</h2>
            <p>In the heart of Munich sits the Odeonsplatz, a culturally significant part of the city. Although Munich has dozens of incredible and beautiful churches, the Theatiner church is one of my personal favourites. Right next to the Theatiner church is the Feldherrnhalle (Field Marshal's Hall), a recreation of the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence; in 1923, Adolf Hitler and his supporters marched toward the Feldherrnhalle but were stopped by police. Throughout the year, many events are held in Odeonsplatz, including concerts and craft markets. During the Second World War, many of the structures throughout Munich were destroyed, this goes for much of Odeonsplatz as well.</p>

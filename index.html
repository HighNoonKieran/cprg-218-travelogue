        <h2>Munich Olympic Park</h2>
        <p>The Olympic Park in Munich was used in 1972 and is now a tourist attraction; these Olympics games were also the site of a massacre when a military group kidnapped and executed Israeli athletes. The stadium and surrounding area are still used for many events, including farmers markets and concerts. The park is listed as a Unesco World Heritage site. </p> </section>

        <h2>English Garden</h2>
        <p>Located a short ways from the Munich University, sits the English Garden. The garden was created in 1789 and is 3.75km squared making it one of the the largest city parks in the world. The name comes from the fact that the park is laid out like the French Baroque parks that were common at the time, but instead is a English landscape park. Within the park is a a Rome styled gazebo, a beer garden, a theatre, resturants and many other things.</p> </section>

            <h2>Odeonsplatz</h2>
            <p>In the heart of Munich sits Odeonsplatz, a culturally significant part of the city. Although Munich has dozens of incredible and beautiful churches, the Theatiner church is one of my personal favourites. Right next to the Theatiner church is the Feldherrnhalle (Field Marshal's Hall), a recreation of the Loggia dei Lanzi in Florence; in 1923, Adolf Hitler and his supporters marched toward the Feldherrnhalle but were stopped by police. Throughout the year, many events are held in Odeonsplatz, including concerts and craft markets. During the second World War, many of the structures throughout Munich were destroyed, this goes for much of Odeonsplatz as well. </p>
